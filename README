6502 to IntyBASIC compiler. http://nanochess.org/

Usage:

    c6502 input.rom output.bas

Only 4K Atari VCS ROMs supported, and it will generate
non-working programs that need a LOT OF ADAPTATION.

Several instructions aren't implemented.

This is a programming aberration, I wrote this to see how easy
would be to port Atari VCS games to Intellivision, but the
resulting code is way too slow for any practical use.

You can add the following line at start of program to ease
adaptation:

    DIM zp(256) AT $00F0

This will tell IntyBASIC to map the 256 bytes RAM memory of
Atari at a fixed position in memory.
